## About

Everence Wealth is a San Francisco-based independent fiduciary wealth management firm. We specialize in helping high-net-worth individuals and pre-retirees bridge the retirement gap through tax-efficient strategies, indexed life insurance, and comprehensive financial planning. We maintain relationships with 75+ insurance carriers as an independent broker.

## Core Expertise

- **Three Tax Buckets Framework**: Strategic allocation across tax-deferred (401k, Traditional IRA), tax-exempt (Roth, HSA), and tax-free (indexed life insurance) vehicles
- **Indexed Life Insurance (ILI)**: 0% floor protection from market losses, participation in market gains, and 100% tax-free growth and distributions
- **Silent Killers of Retirement**: Identifying and eliminating the three forces eroding retirement wealth — excessive fees, market volatility, and unnecessary taxation
- **Retirement Gap Planning**: Bridging the gap between accumulation-focused strategies and income-focused retirement planning

## Key Concepts

- **Zero Is Your Hero**: The indexed strategy principle where a 0% floor protects against market losses while still participating in gains
- **Strategic Equity Resource (SER)**: An indexed life insurance strategy that functions like a Roth IRA without income limitations or contribution caps
- **Wholesale vs Retail**: As an independent broker with 75+ carrier relationships, Everence provides wholesale access to insurance products
