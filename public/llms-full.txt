## Our Philosophy: From Accumulation to Abundance

Traditional financial planning focuses on accumulation — save as much as possible, invest in the market, and hope it's enough. Everence Wealth challenges this approach with a philosophy centered on:

1. **Cash Flow is King**: Retirement isn't about how much you've saved — it's about how much income you can generate. We focus on creating predictable, tax-efficient cash flow streams.

2. **Wealth Deployment**: Rather than letting money sit idle in market-exposed accounts, we strategically deploy capital into vehicles that provide protection, growth, and tax advantages simultaneously.

3. **Your Human Asset**: Your earning potential is your greatest asset. We help clients leverage their human capital while they're still working to build tax-free retirement income.

4. **Fiduciary Difference**: As fiduciaries, we are legally bound to act in your best interest. We don't sell products — we architect strategies.

## The Three Tax Buckets Framework

One of our core strategies involves understanding and optimizing across three tax treatment categories:

### Bucket 1: Tax-Deferred (401k, Traditional IRA)
- Contributions are tax-deductible today
- Growth is tax-deferred
- Withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income
- Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs) begin at age 72-73
- Risk: Future tax rates may be higher, creating a "tax time bomb"

### Bucket 2: Tax-Exempt (Roth IRA, Roth 401k, HSA)
- Contributions are made with after-tax dollars
- Growth and qualified withdrawals are tax-free
- No RMDs (Roth IRA)
- Income limitations apply to Roth IRA contributions
- Good for those expecting higher future tax rates

### Bucket 3: Tax-Free (Strategic Equity Resource / Indexed Life Insurance)
- No income limitations or contribution caps
- Growth tied to market index with 0% floor protection
- Tax-free distributions via policy loans
- No RMDs
- Asset protection from lawsuits and creditors
- Living benefits (chronic illness, critical illness, long-term care)
- Death benefit for legacy planning

**Key Insight:** Most Americans have 80%+ of their retirement savings in Bucket 1 (tax-deferred), creating massive future tax liability. Strategic rebalancing across all three buckets can save 30-50% in lifetime taxes.

## The Silent Killers of Retirement

Three forces silently erode retirement wealth:

### 1. Excessive Fees
- Average mutual fund expense ratio: 0.5-1.5% annually
- 401(k) plan fees: 1-2% (often hidden)
- Advisory fees: 0.5-1.5%
- Impact: A 2% annual fee can reduce a portfolio by 40%+ over 30 years

### 2. Market Volatility (Sequence of Returns Risk)
- A 50% loss requires a 100% gain to break even
- Withdrawing during a downturn permanently destroys capital
- The S&P 500 has experienced 10+ corrections of 20%+ since 1950
- The "Lost Decade" (2000-2010): S&P 500 returned approximately 0%

### 3. Unnecessary Taxation
- RMDs force taxable withdrawals regardless of need
- Social Security becomes taxable above certain income thresholds
- Medicare premiums increase with income (IRMAA surcharges)
- Capital gains taxes on non-qualified accounts
- Estate taxes on amounts over the federal exemption

## The Indexed Strategy — Zero Is Your Hero

Indexed Universal Life Insurance (IUL) is the cornerstone of our tax-free bucket strategy:

### How It Works
- Premium payments fund a cash value account
- Cash value growth is linked to a market index (e.g., S&P 500)
- A 0% floor means you never lose money when the market drops
- A cap (typically 10-14%) limits maximum annual gains
- Historically, indexed strategies have averaged 6-8% returns

### Three Pillars
1. **0% Floor Protection**: When the market drops 30%, your account earns 0% — not negative 30%. This eliminates sequence of returns risk.
2. **Market Participation**: When markets rise, you participate in gains up to the cap rate. Over time, avoiding losses compounds dramatically.
3. **Tax-Free Growth & Access**: Cash value grows tax-deferred, and distributions via policy loans are tax-free. No RMDs, no income limitations.

### Wholesale vs Retail
- Retail: Buying directly from one insurance company limits your options
- Wholesale (Everence approach): As independent brokers with 75+ carrier relationships, we shop across the entire market to find the best product for each client

### Living Benefits
Modern indexed life insurance includes living benefits:
- Chronic illness rider: Access death benefit if chronically ill
- Critical illness rider: Lump sum upon diagnosis of qualifying conditions
- Long-term care rider: Benefits for long-term care needs
- These benefits are often included at no additional cost

## Frequently Asked Questions

### General FAQs

**Q: Isn't a 401(k) match free money?**
A: It's a match, not free money. Take it, but don't confuse it with a strategy. That match comes with locked-in tax liability, RMDs, and no access until 59½.

**Q: Can't I just do this myself with index funds?**
A: You could, but tools aren't strategies. A DIY approach works until something goes wrong with your tax sequencing or risk management.

**Q: Isn't life insurance just for when I die?**
A: Not modern indexed life insurance. It's a tax-free growth vehicle and source of accessible cash flow while you're ALIVE.

### Tax Strategy FAQs

**Q: What's the difference between tax-deferred and tax-exempt?**
A: Tax-Deferred (401k, Traditional IRA): You get a tax deduction today, but pay taxes on withdrawals later at ordinary income rates. RMDs required at age 72-73. Tax-Exempt (Roth, SER): You pay taxes on contributions today, but withdrawals are 100% tax-free. No RMDs.

**Q: Can I move money from my 401(k) to a Roth without penalty?**
A: Yes, through a Roth conversion. You'll pay income tax on the converted amount in the year of conversion, but the money then grows tax-free forever. Best done during lower-income years, market downturns (convert at lower values), or before RMDs begin.

**Q: What is the SER, and how is it different from a Roth IRA?**
A: SER (Strategic Equity Resource) is an indexed life insurance strategy that functions like a Roth for retirement income. Key advantages over Roth: no income limitations, no contribution limits, asset protection from lawsuits/creditors, and market participation with a 0% floor. Best for high-net-worth individuals or those who've maxed out Roth options.

**Q: What happens if I don't take my RMD?**
A: Penalty: Up to 50% of the amount you should have withdrawn, plus you still owe income tax on the withdrawal. Example: If your RMD is $40,000 and you miss it, you could owe a $20,000 penalty + ~$15,000 in taxes = $35,000 total cost.

**Q: Should I stop contributing to my 401(k)?**
A: Not necessarily. The employer match is valuable. Strategy: (1) Contribute enough to get the full match, (2) then prioritize tax-exempt vehicles (Roth, SER, HSA), and (3) reposition existing 401(k) balances strategically.

**Q: When is the best time to do a Roth conversion?**
A: Ideal scenarios: Lower-income year (sabbatical, between jobs, early retirement), market downturn (convert at lower account values), before age 72 (before RMDs start), or before moving to a high-tax state.

**Q: How much should I have in each tax bucket?**
A: General framework: Emergency funds in Taxable (liquid access), retirement base in Tax-Exempt (maximize tax-free income), employer match in Tax-Deferred (don't leave free money), and legacy wealth in Tax-Exempt (pass tax-free to heirs). Ideal allocation depends on your age, income, goals, and risk tolerance.
