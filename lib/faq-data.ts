        question: "Isn't a 401(k) match free money?",
        answer: "It's a match, not free money. Take it, but don't confuse it with a strategy. That match comes with locked-in tax liability, RMDs, and no access until 59½.",
    },
    {
        question: "Can't I just do this myself with index funds?",
        answer: "You could, but tools aren't strategies. A DIY approach works until something goes wrong with your tax sequencing or risk management.",
    },
    {
        question: "Isn't life insurance just for when I die?",
        answer: "Not modern indexed life insurance. It's a tax-free growth vehicle and source of accessible cash flow while you're ALIVE.",

    {
        question: "What's the difference between tax-deferred and tax-exempt?",
        answer: "Tax-Deferred (401k, Traditional IRA): You get a tax deduction today, but pay taxes on withdrawals later at ordinary income rates. RMDs required at age 72-73. Tax-Exempt (Roth, SER): You pay taxes on contributions today, but withdrawals are 100% tax-free. No RMDs.",
    },
    {
        question: "Can I move money from my 401(k) to a Roth without penalty?",
        answer: "Yes, through a Roth conversion. You'll pay income tax on the converted amount in the year of conversion, but the money then grows tax-free forever. Best done during lower-income years, market downturns (convert at lower values), or before RMDs begin.",
    },
    {
        question: "What is the SER, and how is it different from a Roth IRA?",
        answer: "SER (Strategic Equity Resource) is an indexed life insurance strategy that functions like a Roth for retirement income. Key advantages over Roth: no income limitations, no contribution limits, asset protection from lawsuits/creditors, and market participation with a 0% floor. Best for high-net-worth individuals or those who've maxed out Roth options.",
    },
    {
        question: "What happens if I don't take my RMD?",
        answer: "Penalty: Up to 50% of the amount you should have withdrawn, plus you still owe income tax on the withdrawal. Example: If your RMD is $40,000 and you miss it, you could owe a $20,000 penalty + ~$15,000 in taxes = $35,000 total cost.",
    },
    {
        question: "Should I stop contributing to my 401(k)?",
        answer: "Not necessarily. The employer match is valuable. Strategy: (1) Contribute enough to get the full match, (2) then prioritize tax-exempt vehicles (Roth, SER, HSA), and (3) reposition existing 401(k) balances strategically.",
    },
    {
        question: "When is the best time to do a Roth conversion?",
        answer: "Ideal scenarios: Lower-income year (sabbatical, between jobs, early retirement), market downturn (convert at lower account values), before age 72 (before RMDs start), or before moving to a high-tax state.",
    },
    {
        question: "How much should I have in each tax bucket?",
        answer: "General framework: Emergency funds in Taxable (liquid access), retirement base in Tax-Exempt (maximize tax-free income), employer match in Tax-Deferred (don't leave free money), and legacy wealth in Tax-Exempt (pass tax-free to heirs). Ideal allocation depends on your age, income, goals, and risk tolerance.",
